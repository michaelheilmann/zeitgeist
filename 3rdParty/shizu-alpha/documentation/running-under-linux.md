# Running undere Linux
Create a user `shizu` by `adduser shizu`.

Switch to that user whenever you are building or running the server.
To switch to user `shizu` enter `su - shizu`.

Build *Shizu* as described in [Building *Shizu*: Linux](./../building-under-linux.md).
We recommend using `~/shizu-source` as the source directory and `~/shizu-build` as the build directory.

Create a directory `~/shizu-instance`.
